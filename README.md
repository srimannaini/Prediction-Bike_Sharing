# Prediction-Bike_Sharing
## Introduction
In this project, you'll get to build a neural network from scratch to carry out a prediction problem on a real dataset! By building a neural network from the ground up, you'll have a much better understanding of gradient descent, backpropagation, and other concepts that are important to know. You'll also get to see how to apply these networks to solve real prediction problems!

## Dataset
 The data comes from the UCI Machine Learning Database.
 
## Installation setup
Create a new conda environment:
    conda create --name deep-learning python=3.


Enter your new environment:
Mac/Linux: >> source activate deep-learning
Windows: >> activate deep-learning

Install numpy, matplotlib, pandas, and jupyter notebook
conda install numpy matplotlib pandas jupyter notebook

Run the following to open up the notebook server:
jupyter notebook
