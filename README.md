# Prediction-Bike_Sharing
## Introduction
In this project, you'll get to build a neural network from scratch to carry out a prediction problem on a real dataset! By building a neural network from the ground up, you'll have a much better understanding of gradient descent, backpropagation, and other concepts that are important to know. You'll also get to see how to apply these networks to solve real prediction problems!
