# Prediction-Bike_Sharing
## Introduction
In this project, you'll get to build a neural network from scratch to carry out a prediction problem on a real dataset! By building a neural network from the ground up, you'll have a much better understanding of gradient descent, backpropagation, and other concepts that are important to know. You'll also get to see how to apply these networks to solve real prediction problems!

## Dataset
 The data comes from the UCI Machine Learning Database.
 
## Installation setup
<p>Create a new conda environment:</p>

<pre><code>conda create --name deep-learning python=3.
</code></pre>


Enter your new environment:
<p>Mac/Linux:</p>
<pre><code>source activate deep-learning
</code></pre>
<p>Windows:</p>
<pre><code>activate deep-learning
</code></pre>

<p>Install numpy, matplotlib, pandas, and jupyter notebook:</p>
<pre><code>conda install numpy matplotlib pandas jupyter notebook
</code></pre>


<p>Run the following to open up the notebook server:</p>

<pre><code>jupyter notebook
</code></pre>

open the file in notebook environment.
